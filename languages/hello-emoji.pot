"Hello Emoji is a plugin that converts emoticons to emoji. But it's more "
"than a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire "
"generation. It's proof of the idea that WordPress represents: that free "
"software can bring people together to accomplish something that they "
"couldnâ€™t do themselves, while adding something of value to the commons for "
"all to share."
